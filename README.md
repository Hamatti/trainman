Trainman is the first game of indie developer team Nottingham Games. Trainman is a story of a young conductor who spends his workdays travelling with trains and making sure no passenger travels without paying. He starts with basic trains and boring jobs but as his career advances, he gets job offers from all around the world in different trains and environments.

In isometric 2D-ish train levels, player controls a conductor, checks tickets and tries to keep passengers happy with little small talk. After the train reaches its destination, player is rewarded with points based on the satisfaction of the passengers as well as percentage of completed ticket checks.
